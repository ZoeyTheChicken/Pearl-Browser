# Pearl Browser - A modern Windows browser built in C# Win Forms!
TEMPLATE VERSION 2
Supports 18.0.1 as of now
```json
{
  "ThemeName": "Your Theme",

  "Title": "Pearl Browser - [ YOUR THEME ]",
  "FormBackColor": "Color for the Back of the Form",

That is a JSON (they must be JSON files to work.)
