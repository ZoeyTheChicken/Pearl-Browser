# Pearl Browser - the new browser for Windows!
Theme template!!
```json
{
  "ThemeName": "Your Theme",
  "Description": "Your theme for Pearl Browser",
  "Title": "Pearl Browser - [ YOUR THEME ]",
  "FormBackColor": "Color for the Back of the Form",
  "FormForeColor": "Color for the Front of the Form"
  "FileVersion": "1"
}
```
That is a JSON (they must be JSON files to work.)
